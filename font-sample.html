    <h1>So you want to style a website...</h1>
    <h2>Don't worry - it's easy! Just be lame and follow everyone else with a sexy serif title...</h2>
    <p>...and that token sans-serif body because SPAGHETTI MONSTER FORBID a graphic designer looks at your site and decides it's the end of the world for missing the holy bi-fecta of Georgia and Roboto (with maybe a sprinkling of Oswald for emphasis and those ANGRY ALL CAPS TIMES). Wow! You're so unique!</p> 
    <p>BONUS ROUND!!! Why not throw in Lobster (see: the main header) like every other f$#%ing person on planet earth - it's the new Comic Sans and Papyrus!</p>
